For each experiment, we tracked the development of accuracy on the validation dataset for this experiment (1k samples for each experiment, these samples of course match the operation and operand size of the experiment).
To get a better idea not just of final accuracy, but of the development of accuracy during training runs, we also generated accuracy curves, plotting model accuracy at each training/optimization step.
